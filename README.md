# Ecommerce server

Sample express server created for an online shop.
This backend server was created as I was learning express.js, while taking the "NodeJS - The Complete Guide" Udemy course.\
As the main purpose of this project was for me to learn how to build a backend server using express, the server sends ugly html files directly to the browser. Front end design is not the main focus of this project. If I were to actually make an ecommerce application, I would use a frontend framework like React for the user interface.

# Learning objectives met

1. Using the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern
2. Using middleware functions in express and understand how they work
3. Using routers and controllers to handle requests and send responses
4. Using body parser middleware to extract body from post requests
5. Using ejs as a template engine to return html pages
6. Extracting dynamic parameters from route
7. Setting and handling query parameters for get requests
8. Connection to a SQL database (MySQL)
