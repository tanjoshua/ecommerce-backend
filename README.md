# Ecommerce server

Sample express server created for an online shop.
This backend server was created as I was learning express.js, while taking the "NodeJS - The Complete Guide" Udemy course.\
As the main purpose of this project was for me to learn how to build a backend server using express, the server sends ugly html files directly to the browser. Front end design is not the main focus of this project. If I were to actually make an ecommerce application, I would use a frontend framework like React for the user interface.
